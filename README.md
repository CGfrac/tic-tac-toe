# Tic Tac Toe

Exercise for Project Odin.

I made a simple tic tac toe using flex and grid. It can be played solo or with another player.

The real challenge was creating a competent AI by implementing a minimax algorithm.

It ended up working pretty well, though I think some refactor will be needed when I have time.
